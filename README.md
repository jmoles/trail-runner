trail-runner
============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jmoles/trail-runner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jmoles/trail-runner)

This tool was developed as part of my masters's thesis at [Portland State University](http://www.pdx.edu/).

This project takes advantage of other projects to run simulations.

* [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap) for evolutionary algorithms.
* [python-progressbar](https://github.com/WoLpH/python-progressbar) for progress bar during simulations.
* [PyBrain](https://github.com/pybrain/pybrain) for neural networks.
* [SCOOP](https://code.google.com/p/scoop/) for distribution of workload across servers.
* [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) and [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) for various math functions.
